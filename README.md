# Project2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors

For my second project with Code Institute, I have created a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

The following is the Rules of the Game.
1. When the player comes to the page, they see 3 buttons: rock, paper, scissors
2. When the player clicks on one of the buttons, the game begins, the computer
    randomly chooses rock, paper or scissors, and the player's and computer's 
    choices are compared to see who wins.

3. The outcome of the turn is displayed on the screen.

4. Next turn begins 
5. The game ends when either of the players reaches 10 points.

## Testing
I have tested the website using the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge Browsers on a Windows PC. I can confirm that it works on both.
I have used the Chrome Developer tool to check the website for responsiveness. I can conclude that the website works on different screen 
sizes ranging from Desktop to iphone SE screen sizes.

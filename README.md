## Features
### Existing Features

<ul> 
<li>Navigation Bar</li>
        <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>

<li>The Landing Page / Home Page</li>
        <ul>
        <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        
        </ul> 
        <br>
  
<br>

### Features Left to Implement
There are a couple of ideas for future features to be added to The Anxiety Hub.
<ul>
        <li>One idea is to give the user the ability to sign up to meditation apps such as Calm and Aura via an account with The Anxiety Hub. 
        When the user has signed up with The Anxiety Hub, they could choose to subscibe to Calm or Aura or both. </li>
        <li>Another idea is to allow the user to purchase self-help book via the webpage instead of having to go to another webpage to purchase.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a form submitted feature has to be implemented. </li> 
<br>


## Testing
I have tested the website using the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge Browsers on a Windows PC. I can confirm that it works on both.
I have used the Chrome Developer tool to check the website for responsiveness. I can conclude that the website works on different screen 
sizes ranging from Desktop to iphone SE screen sizes.

### Validator testing
The W3C Markup Validator and the W3C CSS Validator were used to validate all pages of the project. All syntax errors were fixed 
apart from the minor bugs on the form.html page.
<ul>
        <li>
        HTML
        <ul><li>When passing the HTML code throught the W3C validator, no errors were returned.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        CSS
        <ul><li>When passing the CSS code through the W3C validator, no errors were returned.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        Lighthouse
        <ul>
        <li><img src="\workspace\The-Anxiety-Hub\assets\css\images\Screenshot 2023-05-07 203741.png"  style="width:700px; height:450px" alt="Lighthouse"></li>
        </ul>
        </li>
</ul>


### Unfixed Bugs
There are a few unfixed errors on the form.html page because the questions have thesame multiple choice answers. 
Also, the form submission does not work due to an error with formdump.codeinstitute server.

## Deployment
The website was deployed to GitHub pages using the following steps:
<ul>
<li>Login to Github, find and click on the GitHub repository.</li>
<li>In the GitHub repository, click on the settings icon.</li>
<li>On the settings page, go to the menu on the left and click on pages.</li>
<li>Under "Source", select branch "Main" and select "Root" folder.</li>
<li>Click Save. The page will automatically refresh and the link to the published site will appear.</li>
<li>This site is published at  <a href="https://shaneduffy91.github.io/The-Anxiety-Hub/" target="_blank" aria-label="The live project">https://shaneduffy91.github.io/The-Anxiety-Hub/</a></li>
